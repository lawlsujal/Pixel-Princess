WELCOME, hero! 
Hi, my name is- oh sorry i'll spare you the introduction we need your help with something urgently, our princess, Pixelina is under threat of being kidnapped by the vile monsters that have come here to the pixel world to ruin our peace.
Take control of Mario, the legend and help the people of the Pixel World by saving Pixelina from these monsters.
    opening the main.c file will open you the GUI(which is currently missing the custom and the manual modes but we'll get it to you ASAP)
    opening the manual.c file will allow you to play the full game but without the GUI(we're working on that too)
Thank You, for stopping by, we hope you enjoy our game :)
oh, and don't forget to keep water by your side always cuz this one is addciting.
